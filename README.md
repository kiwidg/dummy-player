# dummy-player
A basic mp3 player with automatic generation of playlists based on the folders.

To use it, you will need Node.js and npm; then download the project, and `npm install`.

Feel free to change the listening port (by default 2000). 

You then just have to create a folder called "music" in the public folder, and put there all your bird songs classified in folders.
